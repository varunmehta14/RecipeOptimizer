   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./recipes.db
   CHROMA_DIR=./chroma_db
   ```

5. Start the backend server:

   # Running directly from the backend directory:
   uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd app/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Docker Setup

The application is designed to run in Docker:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Build and start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. For development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

## üß™ Running Tests

### Local Testing

You can run tests locally after setting up your development environment:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd app/backend

# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Run tests with pytest
python -m pytest ../tests/
```

Note: Some tests require a Google API key to be set in your environment variables or .env file.

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Recipe Optimization

1. Navigate to the home page
2. Paste your recipe text or upload a PDF
3. Select a dietary goal (e.g., "make gluten-free" or "reduce sugar")
4. Click "Optimize Recipe"
5. Review the suggested modifications

### Advanced Features

- **Custom Goals**: Enter specific dietary requirements
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Monitor changes in nutritional content
- **Recipe History**: Access previously optimized recipes
- **Performance Metrics**: View AI processing statistics

# Docker Usage

This project can be run using Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Google API key for LLM support (Gemini)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cymbio
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

3. Build and start the application:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000`

## Development

For development purposes, you can use the reload flag that's enabled in the docker-compose.yml:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will automatically reload the application when you make changes to the code.

## Container Structure

- The backend runs on port 8000
- Data is persisted in the `chroma_db` directory and `recipes.db` file
- Environment variables can be set in the `.env` file or passed to docker-compose
- Healthchecks ensure the application is running properly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the container logs:

```
docker-compose logs
```

You can also check the application's health endpoint directly:

```
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
