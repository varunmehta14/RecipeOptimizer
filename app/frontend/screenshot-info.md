# Screenshot Information

For the README, you should include a screenshot of the Recipe Optimizer interface. 

Capture a screenshot of the application showing:
1. The Home page with the recipe input form
2. The Result page showing a side-by-side comparison of original and optimized recipes
3. The Database page showing the history of processed recipes

Save the screenshot as `screenshot.png` in the root of the frontend directory.

This will give readers a visual understanding of the application's interface and functionality.
