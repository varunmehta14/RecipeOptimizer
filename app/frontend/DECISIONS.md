# Design Decisions and Challenges

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Component Architecture

We chose to organize the application with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Pages**: Main view components that handle routing and data fetching
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements that can be composed together
- **lib**: Shared utilities and API interfaces

This organization makes the code more maintainable and follows React best practices for component composition.

### 2. Typed API Interface

We designed a comprehensive TypeScript interface (`api.ts`) that mirrors the backend data models. This approach:

- Ensures type safety between frontend and backend
- Provides autocomplete and validation during development
- Makes data transformations more predictable
- Serves as documentation for data structures

### 3. Tailwind CSS for Styling

We chose Tailwind CSS over other styling approaches because:

- It allows for rapid UI development with utility classes
- Provides a constraint-based design system for consistency
- Eliminates CSS file management and naming conflicts
- Works well with component-based architecture
- Offers excellent dark mode support

The `cn()` utility function combines Tailwind classes efficiently, resolving conflicts and handling conditional styles.

### 4. React Query for Data Fetching

Using React Query for API interactions provided:

- Automatic caching and refetching
- Loading and error states management
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Reduced boilerplate compared to manual fetch calls

### 5. DiffText Component for Recipe Comparison

We created a specialized component to show differences between original and optimized recipes:

- Uses word-level diffing rather than character-level for better readability
- Applies visual cues (colors, formatting) to highlight changes
- Handles whitespace appropriately for recipe text

### 6. Responsive Design

The application is designed to work well on all device sizes:

- Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- Adapts navigation for smaller screens
- Optimizes content layout for different viewports
- Uses consistent spacing and typography across devices

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Accurate Recipe Parsing

**Problem**: Recipe formats vary widely, making it difficult to accurately parse ingredients, quantities, and steps.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented structured data models with optional fields
- Used AI to handle the parsing complexity on the backend
- Created a flexible rendering system that works with incomplete data

### Challenge 2: Diff Visualization

**Problem**: Initial character-level diffing split words and made changes difficult to read.

**Solution**:
- Switched to word-level diffing using the `diff` library
- Created custom styling for added and removed content
- Improved the visual clarity of changes with background colors and font styles

### Challenge 3: Performance with Large Recipes

**Problem**: Large recipes with many ingredients caused performance issues in the diff visualization.

**Solution**:
- Optimized the diff algorithm implementation
- Added memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented virtual scrolling for very large recipe displays

### Challenge 4: Responsive Navigation

**Problem**: The navigation needed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Solution**:
- Created button-like navigation elements that are touch-friendly
- Used clear visual indicators for the active page
- Ensured proper spacing and sizing for different screen sizes

### Challenge 5: Dark Mode Support

**Problem**: Supporting both light and dark modes without duplicate styles.

**Solution**:
- Leveraged Tailwind's dark mode utilities
- Created a consistent color scheme that works in both modes
- Used CSS variables for theme colors that change with mode

### Challenge 6: Type Safety with External Libraries

**Problem**: Some third-party libraries lacked proper TypeScript definitions.

**Solution**:
- Created custom type definitions where needed
- Used TypeScript's utility types to adapt existing types
- Implemented runtime type checking as a fallback

## Future Improvements

1. **State Management**: For a larger application, consider adding a more robust state management solution like Redux or Zustand
2. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages
4. **Accessibility**: Further improve accessibility features for users with disabilities
5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading for larger bundles
